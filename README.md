# Python-Project "Habitz"
 Habit Tracker App
 
This app helps the user to acquire positive habits. 
To do this, the user can define habits that he or she has to "work through" within a certain period of time. 
The idea behind “Habitz” is to support the user as best as possible in achieving his or her goal of acquiring positive new habits. 
Extensive analysis options and a reminder function keep the user motivated.

Communication from user to Habitz: 

Communication takes place via a "command line interface".
After opening the app, the user can choose whether to 
create a new habit, 
mark a habit as done, 
analyze his habits or 
leave the app again. 
When the choice is made to "create a new habit", the name of the habit, the description and the interval (daily, weekly, monthly or yearly) in which the habit must be done must be entered. The parameters for creating the habit, the date of completion, the counter of missed completions and the counter of successful completions in a row are created automatically. 

Once the choice is made to "mark a habit as completed", the user is prompted to select the appropriate name from a list of the current habit. After that, a function is executed that marks the habit as completed for the corresponding time period and increases the counter for the corresponding streak by 1. 
If "analyze my habits" is selected, it is possible to display all active habits, a list of habits with the corresponding streak, the longest streak of all times, habit with the most missed completions, the longest streak for a particular habit and a list of all habits with the same periodicity.
