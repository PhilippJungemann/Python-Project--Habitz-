    <span class="s0">with atomic_write('foo.txt', overwrite=True) as f:</span>
        <span class="s0">f.write('Hello world.')</span>

<span class="s0">low-level interfaces.</span>

<span class="s0">Features that distinguish it from other similar libraries (see `Alternatives and Credit`_):</span>

<span class="s0">- Race-free assertion that the target file doesn't yet exist. This can be</span>
  <span class="s0">controlled with the ``overwrite`` parameter.</span>

<span class="s0">- Windows support, although not well-tested. The MSDN resources are not very</span>
  <span class="s0">explicit about which operations are atomic. I'm basing my assumptions off `a</span>

  <span class="s0">by `Doug Cook</span>
  <span class="s0">&lt;https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Profile/doug%20e.%20cook&gt;`_, who appears</span>
  <span class="s0">to be a Microsoft employee:</span>

      <span class="s0">Question: Is MoveFileEx atomic if the existing and new</span>
      <span class="s0">files are both on the same drive?</span>

      <span class="s0">The simple answer is &quot;usually, but in some cases it will silently fall-back</span>
      <span class="s0">to a non-atomic method, so don't count on it&quot;.</span>

      <span class="s0">The implementation of MoveFileEx looks something like this: [...]</span>

      <span class="s0">The problem is if the rename fails, you might end up with a CopyFile, which</span>
      <span class="s0">is definitely not atomic.</span>

      <span class="s0">If you really need atomic-or-nothing, you can try calling</span>
      <span class="s0">NtSetInformationFile, which is unsupported but is much more likely to be</span>
      <span class="s0">atomic. </span>

<span class="s0">- Simple high-level API that wraps a very flexible class-based API.</span>

<span class="s0">- Consistent error handling across platforms.</span>


<span class="s0">How it works</span>
<span class="s0">============</span>

<span class="s0">It uses a temporary file in the same directory as the given path. This ensures</span>
<span class="s0">that the temporary file resides on the same filesystem.</span>

<span class="s0">The temporary file will then be atomically moved to the target location: On</span>
<span class="s0">POSIX, it will use ``rename`` if files should be overwritten, otherwise a</span>
<span class="s0">combination of ``link`` and ``unlink``. On Windows, it uses MoveFileEx_ through</span>
<span class="s0">stdlib's ``ctypes`` with the appropriate flags.</span>

<span class="s0">Note that with ``link`` and ``unlink``, there's a timewindow where the file</span>
<span class="s0">might be available under two entries in the filesystem: The name of the</span>
<span class="s0">temporary file, and the name of the target file.</span>

<span class="s0">Also note that the permissions of the target file may change this way. In some</span>
<span class="s0">situations a ``chmod`` can be issued without any concurrency problems, but</span>
<span class="s0">since that is not always the case, this library doesn't do it by itself.</span>

<span class="s0">.. _MoveFileEx: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365240%28v=vs.85%29.aspx</span>

<span class="s0">fsync</span>
<span class="s0">-----</span>

<span class="s0">On POSIX, ``fsync`` is invoked on the temporary file after it is written (to</span>
<span class="s0">flush file content and metadata), and on the parent directory after the file is</span>
<span class="s0">moved (to flush filename).</span>

<span class="s0">``fsync`` does not take care of disks' internal buffers, but there don't seem</span>
<span class="s0">to be any standard POSIX APIs for that. On OS X, ``fcntl`` is used with</span>
<span class="s0">``F_FULLFSYNC`` instead of ``fsync`` for that reason.</span>

<span class="s0">On Windows, `_commit &lt;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/17618685.aspx&gt;`_</span>
<span class="s0">is used, but there are no guarantees about disk internal buffers.</span>

<span class="s0">Alternatives and Credit</span>
<span class="s0">=======================</span>

<span class="s0">Atomicwrites is directly inspired by the following libraries (and shares a</span>
<span class="s0">minimal amount of code):</span>

<span class="s0">- The Trac project's `utility functions</span>
  <span class="s0">&lt;http://www.edgewall.org/docs/tags-trac-0.11.7/epydoc/trac.util-pysrc.html&gt;`_,</span>
  <span class="s0">also used in `Werkzeug &lt;http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/&gt;`_ and</span>
  <span class="s0">`mitsuhiko/python-atomicfile</span>
  <span class="s0">&lt;https://github.com/mitsuhiko/python-atomicfile&gt;`_. The idea to use</span>
  <span class="s0">``ctypes`` instead of ``PyWin32`` originated there.</span>

<span class="s0">- `abarnert/fatomic &lt;https://github.com/abarnert/fatomic&gt;`_. Windows support</span>
  <span class="s0">(based on ``PyWin32``) was originally taken from there.</span>

<span class="s0">Other alternatives to atomicwrites include:</span>

<span class="s0">- `sashka/atomicfile &lt;https://github.com/sashka/atomicfile&gt;`_. Originally I</span>
  <span class="s0">considered using that, but at the time it was lacking a lot of features I</span>
  <span class="s0">needed (Windows support, overwrite-parameter, overriding behavior through</span>
  <span class="s0">subclassing).</span>

<span class="s0">- The `Boltons library collection &lt;https://github.com/mahmoud/boltons&gt;`_</span>
  <span class="s0">features a class for atomic file writes, which seems to have a very similar</span>
  <span class="s0">``overwrite`` parameter. It is lacking Windows support though.</span>
